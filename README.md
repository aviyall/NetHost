# NetHost

**NetHost** is a lightweight networking tool that leverages [Serveo](https://serveo.net), an online platform providing reverse SSH tunneling.

With NetHost, you can expose a local server from your own computer or network to the internet without any router or firewall configurations.

This tool is ideal for developers and hobbyists who want a simple way to make local services publicly accessible.

## Features
- **Expose Local Services**  
  Easily expose HTTP, TCP, and SSH traffic from your local network to the internet, making development and testing more convenient.

- **Stable Internet Handling**  
  **NetHost** detects your network status. If the internet goes down, it terminates all active processes and automatically restarts once the connection is restored.
- **Serveo Status Management**  
  One of the main challenges with using Serveo is its unpredictable downtime. However, **NetHost** can automatically detect the service status and seamlessly restore the tunneling process once it comes back online, ensuring uninterrupted access to your local services.
