# NetHost

**NetHost** is a lightweight networking tool that leverages [Serveo](https://serveo.net), an online platform providing reverse SSH tunneling.

With NetHost, you can expose a local server from your own computer or network to the internet without any router or firewall configurations.

This tool is ideal for developers and hobbyists who want a simple way to make local services publicly accessible.

## Features
- **Expose Local Services**  
  Easily expose HTTP, TCP, and SSH traffic from your local network to the internet, making development and testing more convenient.
- **Dedicated Web Hosting**  
  NetHost allows you to host webpages on the internet for free with custom domain names. It also helps keep your website alive by sending periodic requests, making it an ideal solution for long-lasting web hosting.
- **Stable Internet Handling**  
  **NetHost** detects your network status. If the internet goes down, it terminates all active processes and automatically restarts once the connection is restored.
- **Serveo Status Handling**  
  One of the main challenges with using Serveo is its unpredictable downtime. However, **NetHost** can automatically detect the service status and seamlessly restore the tunneling process once it comes back online, ensuring uninterrupted access to your local services.
- **SSH Server**  
  One of the standout features of this tool is its ability to turn any internet-connected device into an SSH server with no additional setup required.
